        <h2>About Khwaahish</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="dot">&#x2022;</span>Khwaahish was formed in 2017 by Ayushi Nagar, a young social entrepreneur who brought together a group of
            committed individuals aiming to make an impact on the ground by addressing a variety of societal issues. The
            NGO, which is based in Kashipur, Uttarakhand, and has volunteers from all across the country, works in the
            sectors of education, health, hygiene, animal welfare, and much more.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="dot">&#x2022;</span>The blue wings in our logo represent giving wings to children’s dreams and helping them fly towards a bright
            future that can help underprivileged youths which is exactly what we are doing at Khwaahish - making a
            difference in the lives of people from underprivileged communities.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="dot">&#x2022;</span>Day by day, it is enlarging its reach to include more than 500 community volunteers. The Khwaahish NGO
            collaborates with the Kashipur Municipal Corporation and several organizations. We currently run our
            programs, such as ‘NEEV,’ ‘SARA,’ ‘SAMPOORNA,’ and ‘AAROGYAM,’ and we also organize various types of social
            upliftment activities to address other concerns regularly.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="dot">&#x2022;</span>We would like to remind you that 40 percent of India’s population is under the age of 18, giving it the
            world’s largest child population at 400 million. Khwaahish is committed to ending the massive violation of
            people’s fundamental rights, particularly those of children living in India’s slums. We want to empower them
            with education by applying development strategies that are adapted to the community’s requirements.</p>
